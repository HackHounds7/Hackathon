# Plant Recognition Project with VGG19

## Introduction
This plant recognition project utilizes the VGG19 deep learning model to classify plants into 10 different classes. The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and robust system for plant identification, which can have applications in agriculture, botany, and environmental monitoring.

## Project Overview
- *Model*: VGG19, a well-known convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, is used as the backbone for plant recognition. The model has been pretrained on a large dataset and fine-tuned for the specific plant classes in this project.

- *Dataset*: The dataset consists of images of 10 different plant species, each with a substantial number of samples. Data augmentation techniques have been applied to increase the diversity of training data.

- *Training*: The model has been trained on a high-performance GPU to achieve optimal accuracy. Training parameters, including learning rate and batch size, have been fine-tuned for the best results.

- *Evaluation*: Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate validation dataset. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in plant classification.

## Usage
1. *Requirements*: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Python, TensorFlow, and other libraries. You can find the detailed requirements in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. *Dataset*: Prepare your dataset or use the provided dataset. Organize the images into classes corresponding to the 10 plant species.

3. *Training*: Train the VGG19 model using the provided training script. You can customize training parameters as needed.

4. *Inference*: After training, you can use the trained model for plant recognition on new images. Sample inference code is provided in the `inference.py` script.

# Supply Chain Management System

## Introduction
This repository contains the source code and documentation for our Supply Chain Management System. This system is designed to streamline and optimize various aspects of the supply chain process.

## Features
- *Inventory Management:* Keep track of product stock levels, reorder points, and inventory turnover.
- *Order Processing:* Manage orders from creation to delivery, including order status tracking.
- *Supplier Management:* Maintain a database of suppliers and their contact information.
- *Demand Forecasting:* Utilize data analytics to predict demand patterns and optimize inventory levels.
- *Shipping and Logistics:* Coordinate shipping and delivery routes for cost-efficiency.
- *Reporting:* Generate reports on inventory, sales, and supplier performance.
